# Rules

## The deck

- 32 cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8?, 7?)
- 28 cards (7s omitted)
- 24 cards (7s and 8s omitted)

## Object of the game

- The goal is to win at least three tricks. If the side that fixed the trump fails to get three tricks, it is said to be **euchred**. Winning all five tricks is called a **march**

## Card values/scoring

The following shows all scoring situations:

- Partnership making trump wins 3 or 4 tricks – 1 point
- Partnership making trump wins 5 tricks – 2 points
- Lone hand wins 3 or 4 tricks – 1 point
- Lone hand wins 5 tricks – 4 points
- Partnership or lone hand is euchred, opponents score 2 points

The first player or partnership to score 5, 7 or 10 points, as agreed beforehand, wins the game. In the 5-point game, a side is said to be **at the bridge** when it has scored 4 and the opponents have scored 2 or less.
